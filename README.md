# Merge All Files in a Directory

Merges all files in a directory into a merged_file.txt

Use it to merge fragmented data files (csv, json, xml, etc) into one file.

JAR file can accept a numerical parameter to indicate how many lines from the top of the file to skip (Use this to skip reading of headers from each file).

Program was created due to the repeated need to merge json and csv files together.
